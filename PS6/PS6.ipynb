    "In this problem set, you will be applying web scraping techniques taught in class on IMDB website. IMDB is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online. As of January 2020, IMDb has approximately 6.5 million titles (including episodes) and 10.4 million personalities in its database, as well as 83 million registered users. It is the leading website which provides ratings and reviews from audience all over the world. If you are interested in analyzing data about movies, you certainly need to look into IMDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, please refer to this web address, https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?groups=top_1000&sort=user_rating. The main goal here is to scrape relevant information of top-1000 high-rated movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several useful hints and requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You need to scrape 8 relevant variables and store them in separate columns of your dataframe. The column names are provided as **name, year, certificate, runtime, genre, rating, votes, and gross.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We are interested in top-1000 highest-rated movies on imdb. And the web page only return **50** of them on each page. So, you need to scrape through different webpages and combine the information together.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For some movies, they do not have the information available on the web page. For example, some movies do not have ‘gross’. You will need to handle this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. I have provided a random sample of 10 movies. Your final result should resemble the dataframe.\n"
